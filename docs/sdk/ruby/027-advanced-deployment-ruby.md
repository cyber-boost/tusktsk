# 🚀 TuskLang Ruby Advanced Deployment Guide

**"We don't bow to any king" - Ruby Edition**

Deploy with confidence: blue/green, canary, and zero-downtime strategies for TuskLang-powered Ruby apps.

## 🟦 Blue/Green Deployment

### 1. Strategy
- Maintain two environments (blue and green).
- Deploy new version to green, test, then switch traffic.

### 2. Example with Docker Compose
```yaml
services:
  app-blue:
    image: myapp:blue
    ...
  app-green:
    image: myapp:green
    ...
  nginx:
    image: nginx
    ...
    # Switch upstream between blue and green
```

## 🟨 Canary Deployment

### 1. Strategy
- Deploy new version to a small subset of users.
- Gradually increase traffic as confidence grows.

### 2. Example with Kubernetes
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-canary
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
      track: canary
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        track: canary
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: myapp:canary
```

## 🟩 Zero-Downtime Deployment

### 1. Strategy
- Use rolling updates and health checks.
- Ensure old version is only stopped after new is healthy.

### 2. Example with Capistrano
```ruby
# config/deploy.rb
set :keep_releases, 5
set :linked_files, fetch(:linked_files, []).push('config/app.tsk')
set :linked_dirs, fetch(:linked_dirs, []).push('log', 'tmp/pids', 'tmp/cache', 'tmp/sockets')

namespace :deploy do
  after :publishing, :restart
end
```

## 🛡️ Best Practices
- Always validate configs before switching traffic.
- Monitor metrics and roll back on errors.
- Automate deployment with CI/CD tools.
