## Service Discovery

```php
// config/microservices.tsk
microservices = {
    discovery = {
        provider = "consul"
        endpoints = ["http://consul1:8500", "http://consul2:8500"]
        health_check_interval = "10s"
        retry_policy = {
            max_attempts = 5
            backoff = "exponential"
        }
    }
    
    registry = {
        auto_register = true
        tags = ["php", "tusklang", "v1"]
        metadata = {
            version = "1.0.0"
            region = "us-east-1"
        }
    }
}
```

## API Gateway Integration

Integrate with API gateways for routing, security, and rate limiting:

```php
// config/api-gateway.tsk
api_gateway = {
    provider = "kong"
    endpoints = ["http://kong:8000"]
    authentication = "jwt"
    rate_limit = {
        requests = 1000
        window = "1m"
    }
    cors = {
        allow_origins = ["*"]
        allow_methods = ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]
    }
}
```

## Service Mesh Patterns

Leverage service mesh for traffic management, security, and observability:

```php
// config/service-mesh.tsk
service_mesh = {
    provider = "istio"
    mtls = true
    tracing = true
    traffic_policy = {
        retries = 3
        timeout = "5s"
        circuit_breaker = {
            max_connections = 100
            error_threshold = 0.5
        }
    }
}
```

## Resilience and Circuit Breakers

Implement circuit breakers and fallback strategies:

```php
<?php
// app/Microservices/CircuitBreaker.php

namespace App\Microservices;

class CircuitBreaker
{
    private int $failureCount = 0;
    private int $successCount = 0;
    private int $threshold;
    private int $timeout;
    private bool $open = false;
    private int $lastFailureTime = 0;

    public function __construct(int $threshold = 5, int $timeout = 30)
    {
        $this->threshold = $threshold;
        $this->timeout = $timeout;
    }

    public function call(callable $serviceCall)
    {
        if ($this->open && (time() - $this->lastFailureTime) < $this->timeout) {
            throw new \RuntimeException('Circuit is open');
        }

        try {
            $result = $serviceCall();
            $this->successCount++;
            $this->failureCount = 0;
            $this->open = false;
            return $result;
        } catch (\Exception $e) {
            $this->failureCount++;
            $this->lastFailureTime = time();
            if ($this->failureCount >= $this->threshold) {
                $this->open = true;
            }
            throw $e;
        }
    }
}
```

## Distributed Transactions

Support for Sagas and 2PC:

```php
// config/transactions.tsk
distributed_transactions = {
    pattern = "saga"
    compensation = true
    timeout = "60s"
}
```

## Event-Driven Microservices

```php
// config/events.tsk
events = {
    broker = "kafka"
    topics = ["user.created", "order.placed"]
    retry_policy = {
        max_attempts = 10
        backoff = "linear"
    }
}
```

## Security and Zero Trust

```php
// config/security.tsk
security = {
    zero_trust = true
    mutual_tls = true
    api_keys = true
    audit_logging = true
}
```

## Observability and Tracing

```php
// config/observability.tsk
observability = {
    tracing = true
    provider = "jaeger"
    metrics = true
    logs = true
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use service mesh for traffic management and security
- Implement circuit breakers and retries for resilience
- Use distributed tracing for observability
- Prefer event-driven communication for decoupling
- Secure all endpoints with zero trust principles
- Monitor, log, and alert on all service interactions
