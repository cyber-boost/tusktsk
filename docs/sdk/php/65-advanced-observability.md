## Distributed Tracing

```php
// config/observability.tsk
observability = {
    tracing = true
    provider = "jaeger"
    sampling_rate = 0.1
    propagate_headers = true
}
```

## Metrics Collection

- Integrate with Prometheus, StatsD, or CloudWatch
- Use TuskLang @metrics operator for custom metrics
- Collect application, infrastructure, and business metrics

## Log Aggregation

- Use ELK stack, Loki, or Cloud-native logging
- Centralize logs for all services
- Use TuskLang for log routing and filtering

## Alerting and Incident Response

- Integrate with PagerDuty, Opsgenie, or Slack
- Use TuskLang for alert rules and escalation policies
- Automate incident response workflows

## User Experience Monitoring

- Use Real User Monitoring (RUM) tools
- Track frontend and backend performance
- Correlate user sessions with backend traces

## Security Monitoring

- Monitor for suspicious activity and anomalies
- Use TuskLang for security event logging
- Integrate with SIEM platforms

## Best Practices

- Instrument everything
- Correlate logs, metrics, and traces
- Automate alerting and response
- Monitor user experience end-to-end
- Secure all observability data

This guide covers advanced observability in TuskLang with PHP integration, enabling you to monitor, trace, and secure distributed systems with confidence.
