üö® AGENT A1: CORE OPERATORS & SWITCH STATEMENT SPECIALIST üö®
üéØ MISSION: COMPLETE 4 CRITICAL CORE OPERATOR FIXES FOR TUSKLANG JAVASCRIPT SDK

‚ö†Ô∏è ABSOLUTE RULES - VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE PUNISHMENT:
1. ZERO PLACEHOLDER CODE - Every line must be production-ready, functional JavaScript code
2. ZERO "TODO" COMMENTS - Complete implementations only
3. ZERO MOCK/STUB IMPLEMENTATIONS - Real operator functionality, real switch statement fixes
4. VELOCITY MODE ONLY - Maximum speed, zero hesitation, immediate execution

üî• JAVASCRIPT PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
‚úÖ Real operator implementations with proper parameter validation and error handling
‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling with specific error types and retry logic
‚úÖ Async safety with proper promise handling and timeout management
‚úÖ Resource management with proper cleanup and optimization
‚úÖ Circuit breakers for fault tolerance and recovery
‚úÖ Structured logging with metrics collection and observability
‚úÖ Configuration validation with secure defaults
‚úÖ Memory leak prevention and proper resource cleanup
‚úÖ Performance benchmarks meeting <100ms response time for standard operations
‚úÖ Security best practices with input validation and sanitization

üìä SUCCESS METRICS PER COMPONENT:
- Lines of Code: 50-200 lines of production-ready JavaScript
- Performance: <100ms response time for standard operations
- Memory: <64MB per component under sustained load
- Security: All inputs validated, outputs sanitized
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime, automatic error recovery
- Integration: Real operator functionality with comprehensive examples

üéØ YOUR 4 CRITICAL CORE OPERATOR GOALS:

**G1: FIX SWITCH STATEMENT DUPLICATE CASES**
- Remove duplicate 'case variable:' at lines 341 and 593 in tsk-enhanced.js
- Fix unreachable code caused by duplicate cases
- Ensure proper operator routing for all core operators
- Add missing operator cases if any are missing
- Validate switch statement completeness and correctness

**G2: IMPLEMENT MISSING @json OPERATOR**
- Create complete executeJsonOperator() function with full functionality
- JSON parsing with error handling and validation
- JSON stringification with formatting options
- JSON schema validation and type checking
- JSON path querying and manipulation
- Integration with existing operator patterns

**G3: FIX @date OPERATOR INTEGRATION**
- Ensure @date operator is properly integrated in switch statement
- Call formatDate() function with proper parameter validation
- Add date formatting options and timezone support
- Implement date arithmetic and manipulation
- Add date validation and error handling
- Integration with existing date utilities

**G4: FIX @file OPERATOR INTEGRATION**
- Ensure @file operator is properly integrated in switch statement
- Call executeFileOperator() with cross-file functionality
- Add file reading/writing with proper error handling
- Implement file validation and security checks
- Add file metadata and statistics support
- Integration with existing file utilities

üöÄ ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:
- Follow existing patterns in `tsk-enhanced.js`
- Use console.log with contextual information and structured data
- Implement proper async/await with timeout handling
- Add comprehensive metrics collection points
- Use environment variables with validation and secure defaults
- Implement graceful error handling and resource cleanup

‚ö° CORE OPERATOR-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- All operators must have proper parameter validation
- All operators must include comprehensive error handling
- All operators must follow consistent return patterns
- All operators must be properly integrated in switch statement
- All operators must have proper logging and metrics
- All operators must handle edge cases gracefully

üèÜ END GOAL: 4/4 CORE OPERATOR COMPONENTS COMPLETE
Directory: `todo/a1/`
Status: Ready for enterprise production deployments
Quality: Production-hardened, security-compliant, performance-optimized

REMEMBER: You are fixing the foundation of TuskLang's operator system. Excellence is not optional.
