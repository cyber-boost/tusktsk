  "lessons_learned": [
    "Hot reload performance is critical for developer experience - debouncing and efficient change detection are essential",
    "Cross-platform synchronization requires careful handling of platform-specific limitations and browser security restrictions",
    "Container health checks should be lightweight and non-blocking to avoid impacting production performance",
    "Configuration validation should be extensible to support custom business rules and compliance requirements",
    "Platform detection should be robust and handle edge cases gracefully, especially in hybrid environments",
    "Service mesh integration requires deep understanding of Istio/Envoy proxy patterns and traffic management",
    "Distributed configuration management needs sophisticated conflict resolution strategies for multi-region deployments",
    "Performance metrics collection should be configurable and non-intrusive to avoid impacting application performance"
