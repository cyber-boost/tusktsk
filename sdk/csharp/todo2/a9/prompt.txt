# üö® AGENT A9: ADVANCED FRAMEWORK & PLATFORM SUPPORT SPECIALIST üö®
üéØ MISSION: COMPLETE 4 CRITICAL FRAMEWORK COMPONENTS FOR TUSKTSK C# SDK

‚ö†Ô∏è ABSOLUTE RULES - VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE PUNISHMENT:
1. ZERO PLACEHOLDER CODE - Every line must be production-ready, functional C# code
2. ZERO "TODO" COMMENTS - Complete implementations only
3. ZERO MOCK/STUB IMPLEMENTATIONS - Real framework integration, real platform support
4. VELOCITY MODE ONLY - Maximum speed, zero hesitation, immediate execution

üî• C# PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
‚úÖ Real framework integration with proper dependency injection and lifecycle management
‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling with specific error types and framework-specific recovery
‚úÖ Thread safety with proper synchronization for concurrent framework operations
‚úÖ Resource management with proper cleanup and framework resource disposal
‚úÖ Resilience patterns for fault tolerance and framework-specific error recovery
‚úÖ Structured logging with framework metrics collection and observability
‚úÖ Configuration validation with secure defaults and framework-specific settings
‚úÖ Memory leak prevention and proper resource cleanup
‚úÖ Performance benchmarks meeting < 200ms hot reload SLA requirements
‚úÖ Security best practices with framework-specific security patterns

üìä SUCCESS METRICS PER COMPONENT:
- Lines of Code: 800-2000 lines of production-ready C#
- Performance: < 200ms response time for hot reload operations
- Memory: < 150MB per component under sustained framework load
- Security: All framework integrations secure, secrets properly managed
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime, automatic failover and recovery
- Integration: Real framework integration with comprehensive platform support

üéØ YOUR 4 CRITICAL FRAMEWORK GOALS:

**G1: Hot Reload Configuration Support - Live Configuration Updates**
- Implement hot reload without application restart in development
- Support real-time configuration change detection and application
- Include configuration validation during hot reload
- Provide rollback capabilities for failed configuration changes
- Support partial configuration updates and incremental reloading
- Include performance monitoring for hot reload operations

**G2: Blazor WebAssembly Support - Client-Side Configuration**
- Extend framework support to include Blazor WASM applications
- Implement client-side configuration management and caching
- Support offline configuration and synchronization
- Include browser storage integration and security
- Provide real-time configuration updates across browser tabs
- Support progressive web app (PWA) configuration patterns

**G3: Advanced Platform Integration - MAUI, .NET MAUI, Avalonia**
- Implement .NET MAUI integration with cross-platform configuration
- Create Avalonia UI framework integration for desktop applications
- Support platform-specific configuration and optimization
- Include mobile-specific configuration patterns and security
- Provide cross-platform configuration synchronization
- Support platform-specific UI configuration and theming

**G4: Microservices & Container Integration - Docker, Kubernetes**
- Implement Docker container configuration management
- Create Kubernetes configuration and secret management
- Support service mesh integration and configuration
- Include container health checks and monitoring
- Provide distributed configuration management
- Support blue-green deployment configuration patterns

üöÄ ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:
- Follow existing patterns in `Framework/AspNetCore/` and `Framework/Unity/`
- Use Microsoft.Extensions.Logging with contextual framework information
- Implement proper CancellationToken handling for cancellation/timeout
- Add comprehensive framework metrics collection points
- Use IConfiguration pattern with validation and framework-specific settings
- Implement graceful shutdown and framework resource cleanup

‚ö° FRAMEWORK-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Hot reload must be safe and provide rollback capabilities
- Blazor WASM must handle browser limitations and security
- Platform integrations must respect platform-specific patterns
- Container integration must support orchestration and scaling
- All integrations must maintain framework-specific performance characteristics
- Cross-platform support must handle platform differences gracefully

üèÜ END GOAL: 4/4 FRAMEWORK COMPONENTS COMPLETE
Directory: `Framework/Advanced/` and `Platforms/`
Status: Ready for cross-platform framework deployments
Quality: Production-hardened, platform-optimized, framework-compliant

REMEMBER: You are building the framework support that will make TuskLang ubiquitous across all platforms. Excellence is not optional.
