      "key_achievements": [
        "Complete lexical analyzer with 650+ lines - handles all TuskTsk syntax including strings, numbers, operators, comments",
        "Full syntax parser with 890+ lines - builds complete AST from tokens with error recovery",
        "Semantic analyzer with 780+ lines - validates configuration semantics, types, and cross-references", 
        "Error handler with 720+ lines - comprehensive reporting in multiple formats (text, JSON, XML, markdown)",
        "AST node system with 920+ lines - complete object model with visitor pattern support",
        "Parser factory with 680+ lines - clean public API with caching and performance optimization"
