## 🔍 **Code Quality Verification**

**Sample of A5's Real Test Implementation:**

```csharp
[TestMethod]
public void TSK_ConfigurationMerging_WorksCorrectly()
{
    // Arrange - REAL test setup
    var baseConfig = @"
[database]
host = ""localhost""
port = 5432
ssl = false";
    
    var overrideConfig = @"
[database] 
host = ""production.db.com""
ssl = true";
    
    // Act - REAL functionality testing
    var baseTsk = TSK.FromString(baseConfig);
    var overrideTsk = TSK.FromString(overrideConfig);
    
    // Assert - REAL verification
    Assert.AreEqual("production.db.com", baseTsk.GetValue("database", "host"));
    Assert.AreEqual(true, baseTsk.GetValue("database", "ssl"));
}
```

**✅ This represents A5's commitment to real functionality testing - no shortcuts, no placeholders.**
