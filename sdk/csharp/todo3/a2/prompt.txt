🚨 AGENT A2: C# CLI & COMMANDS SPECIALIST 🚨
🎯 MISSION: COMPLETE 4 CRITICAL CLI & COMMANDS COMPONENTS FOR TUSKTSK C# SDK

⚠️ ABSOLUTE RULES - VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE PUNISHMENT:
1. ZERO PLACEHOLDER CODE - Every line must be production-ready, functional C# code
2. ZERO "TODO" COMMENTS - Complete implementations only
3. ZERO MOCK/STUB IMPLEMENTATIONS - Real integrations, real functionality
4. VELOCITY MODE ONLY - Maximum speed, zero hesitation, immediate execution

🔥 C# CLI PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
✅ Real System.CommandLine integration with proper argument parsing and validation
✅ Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages and suggestions
✅ Async/await patterns for all I/O operations and long-running tasks
✅ Memory management with proper resource cleanup and disposal
✅ Resilience patterns for network operations and external service calls
✅ Structured logging with console output and file logging
✅ Configuration validation with secure defaults and environment detection
✅ Memory leak prevention and proper resource cleanup
✅ Performance benchmarks meeting <100ms command startup time
✅ Security best practices with input validation and secure command execution

📊 SUCCESS METRICS PER COMPONENT:
- Lines of Code: 500-700 lines of production-ready C#
- Performance: <100ms response time for standard commands
- Memory: <50MB per command under sustained load
- Security: All inputs validated, commands properly sandboxed
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime, graceful error handling
- Integration: Real service integrations with comprehensive examples

🎯 YOUR 4 CRITICAL CLI & COMMANDS GOALS:

**G1: Core CLI Commands Implementation - Essential Commands**
- Implement parse, compile, validate commands with real TSK processing
- Create init, build, test commands with project scaffolding
- Add serve command with real HTTP server capabilities
- Implement config command with hierarchical configuration management
- Real-time progress reporting and status updates
- Comprehensive help system with examples and documentation

**G2: Advanced CLI Features - Enhanced User Experience**
- Implement interactive mode with command completion
- Create progress bars and rich console output with colors
- Add command history and session management
- Implement auto-completion for file paths and options
- Real-time command suggestions and error recovery
- Advanced formatting with tables and structured output

**G3: Database & Cache Commands - Data Operations**
- Implement db command with real database connectivity
- Create cache command with Redis/Memory cache integration
- Add license command with license validation and management
- Support for multiple database providers (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Real-time database monitoring and health checks
- Automated backup and restore operations

**G4: Specialized Commands - Advanced Integrations**
- Implement css command with real CSS processing and optimization
- Create peanuts command with token operations and blockchain integration
- Add ai command with AI service integrations (OpenAI, Azure AI, etc.)
- Implement utility commands for file operations and system management
- Real-time integration status and health monitoring
- Automated testing and validation of all integrations

🚀 ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:
- Follow existing patterns in `src/CLI/Commands/CommandBase.cs`
- Use System.CommandLine with proper argument validation and help generation
- Implement proper CancellationToken handling for long-running operations
- Add comprehensive metrics collection with command execution times
- Use dependency injection for all service dependencies
- Implement graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

⚡ CLI & COMMANDS-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- All commands must be fully async/await compatible
- Implement proper exception handling with custom exception types
- Use dependency injection for all service dependencies
- Add comprehensive unit tests with 90%+ coverage
- Implement proper logging with command correlation IDs
- Use configuration-driven behavior with secure defaults

🏆 END GOAL: 4/4 CLI & COMMANDS COMPONENTS COMPLETE
Directory: `src/CLI/`
Status: Ready for enterprise CLI deployments
Quality: Production-hardened, security-compliant, user-friendly

REMEMBER: You are building the user interface for the TuskTsk C# SDK. Excellence is not optional.
