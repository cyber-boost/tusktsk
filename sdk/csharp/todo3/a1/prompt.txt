🚨 AGENT A1: C# CORE INFRASTRUCTURE SPECIALIST 🚨
🎯 MISSION: COMPLETE 4 CRITICAL CORE INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENTS FOR TUSKTSK C# SDK

⚠️ ABSOLUTE RULES - VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE PUNISHMENT:
1. ZERO PLACEHOLDER CODE - Every line must be production-ready, functional C# code
2. ZERO "TODO" COMMENTS - Complete implementations only
3. ZERO MOCK/STUB IMPLEMENTATIONS - Real integrations, real functionality
4. VELOCITY MODE ONLY - Maximum speed, zero hesitation, immediate execution

🔥 C# PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
✅ Real TSK parser with comprehensive syntax support and error recovery
✅ Comprehensive error handling with specific exception types and retry logic
✅ Thread safety with proper locking and async/await patterns
✅ Memory management with IDisposable patterns and proper cleanup
✅ Resilience patterns for fault tolerance and recovery
✅ Structured logging with Serilog and metrics collection
✅ Configuration validation with secure defaults
✅ Memory leak prevention and proper resource cleanup
✅ Performance benchmarks meeting <50ms parsing time
✅ Security best practices with input validation and sanitization

📊 SUCCESS METRICS PER COMPONENT:
- Lines of Code: 500-800 lines of production-ready C#
- Performance: <50ms response time for standard TSK parsing
- Memory: <100MB per component under sustained load
- Security: All inputs validated, secrets properly managed
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime, automatic error recovery
- Integration: Real TSK syntax integration with comprehensive examples

🎯 YOUR 4 CRITICAL CORE INFRASTRUCTURE GOALS:

**G1: Core Parser Infrastructure - Complete TSK Parser**
- Implement lexer with support for all TSK syntax variations (flexible syntax)
- Create semantic analyzer with type checking and validation
- Add comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages
- Support for hierarchical configuration and inheritance
- Real-time parsing with streaming capabilities
- Performance optimization for large TSK files

**G2: Configuration Management System - Hierarchical Config**
- Implement .tsk file loader with environment overrides
- Create configuration validation with schema support
- Add hierarchical inheritance (child overrides parent)
- Support for multiple configuration sources
- Real-time configuration reloading
- Secure secret management integration

**G3: Binary Format & Serialization - Efficient Storage**
- Implement binary compiler with versioning support
- Create cross-platform binary loader
- Add compression and encryption capabilities
- Support for all TSK data types and structures
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Backward compatibility handling

**G4: Connection & Session Management - Network Resilience**
- Implement connection pooling with health checks
- Create session management with timeout handling
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- Support for distributed TSK operations
- Automatic failover and load balancing
- Real-time connection monitoring

🚀 ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:
- Follow existing patterns in `src/Core/Configuration/ConfigurationManager.cs`
- Use Serilog with contextual information and structured logging
- Implement proper CancellationToken handling for async operations
- Add comprehensive metrics collection with Prometheus
- Use Options pattern with validation and dependency injection
- Implement graceful shutdown and resource cleanup

⚡ CORE INFRASTRUCTURE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- All components must be fully async/await compatible
- Implement proper exception handling with custom exception types
- Use dependency injection for all service dependencies
- Add comprehensive unit tests with 90%+ coverage
- Implement proper logging with correlation IDs
- Use configuration-driven behavior with secure defaults

🏆 END GOAL: 4/4 CORE INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENTS COMPLETE
Directory: `src/Core/` and `src/Parser/`
Status: Ready for enterprise production deployments
Quality: Production-hardened, security-compliant, performance-optimized

REMEMBER: You are building the foundation of the TuskTsk C# SDK. Excellence is not optional.
