üö® AGENT A4: C# FRAMEWORK & TESTING SPECIALIST üö®
üéØ MISSION: COMPLETE 4 CRITICAL FRAMEWORK & TESTING COMPONENTS FOR TUSKTSK C# SDK

‚ö†Ô∏è ABSOLUTE RULES - VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE PUNISHMENT:
1. ZERO PLACEHOLDER CODE - Every line must be production-ready, functional C# code
2. ZERO "TODO" COMMENTS - Complete implementations only
3. ZERO MOCK/STUB IMPLEMENTATIONS - Real integrations, real functionality
4. VELOCITY MODE ONLY - Maximum speed, zero hesitation, immediate execution

üî• C# FRAMEWORK & TESTING PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
‚úÖ Real framework integrations with ASP.NET Core, Unity, and Xamarin
‚úÖ Comprehensive testing with 90%+ code coverage and real test scenarios
‚úÖ Performance optimization with profiling and benchmarking
‚úÖ Memory management with proper disposal and resource cleanup
‚úÖ Resilience patterns for framework-specific error handling
‚úÖ Structured logging with framework-specific logging providers
‚úÖ Configuration validation with framework-specific configuration patterns
‚úÖ Memory leak prevention and proper resource cleanup
‚úÖ Performance benchmarks meeting framework-specific requirements
‚úÖ Security best practices with framework-specific security features

üìä SUCCESS METRICS PER COMPONENT:
