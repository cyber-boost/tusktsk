# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: C# SDK OPERATORS MASTER PLAN - CORRECTED STRUCTURE
**Date:** January 23, 2025  
**EMERGENCY:** C# SDK claims 77 operators but 28+ files are MISSING  
**Agents:** 5 agents maximum (a1-a5)  
**G Folders:** Multiple g folders per agent with 3+ goals each  
**Timeline:** 5-7 days MAXIMUM  
**Priority:** CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE

## ðŸ”¥ **CRISIS SUMMARY**
- **Registry Claims:** 77 operators registered in OperatorRegistry.cs
- **Files Exist:** Only 49 actual operator files found
- **MISSING:** 28+ critical operator implementations
- **Impact:** Entire C# SDK is NON-FUNCTIONAL

## ðŸ“Š **AGENT DISTRIBUTION (5 AGENTS MAX)**

| Agent | Focus Area | G Folders | Total Goals | Priority |
|-------|------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| A1 | Core Foundation | g1-g4 | 12+ goals | CRITICAL |
| A2 | Communication & Messaging | g5-g8 | 12+ goals | HIGH |
| A3 | Cloud & Infrastructure | g9-g12 | 12+ goals | HIGH |
| A4 | Security & Enterprise | g13-g16 | 12+ goals | MEDIUM |
| A5 | Testing & Validation | g17-g20 | 12+ goals | CRITICAL |

## ðŸŽ¯ **G FOLDER STRUCTURE**
Each G folder contains:
- **prompt.txt** - Clear instructions with punishment warnings
- **goals.json** - 3+ specific goals for that area
- **ideas.json** - Updated by agent during work
- **status.json** - Real-time progress tracking
- **summary.json** - Completion report

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL MISSING OPERATORS**
```
Cache, Query, Variable, Env, Grpc, Webhook, Amqp, Kafka, 
Nats, Neural, Kubernetes, Consul, Etcd, Metrics, Logs, 
Alerts, Prometheus, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, Chef, 
Puppet, Rbac, Audit, Compliance, Governance, Policy, 
Ai, Quantum, Blockchain, IoT, Jaeger, Zipkin, Grafana, 
Istio, Workflow, Uptime, Temporal, Status, Health
```

## âš¡ **VELOCITY MODE REQUIREMENTS**
- **NO PLACEHOLDERS** - Production quality code only
- **SEVERE PUNISHMENT** for non-compliance
- **Complete implementations** with full functionality
- **Comprehensive testing** with 90%+ coverage
- **Performance targets** must be met or exceeded
- **Documentation** complete with XML comments

## ðŸŽ‰ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**
- All 77 operators implemented and functional
- OperatorRegistry.cs matches actual files
- Performance exceeds PHP SDK by 50%
- Zero breaking changes
- Production-ready deployment
