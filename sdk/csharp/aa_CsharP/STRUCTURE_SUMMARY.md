**Date:** January 23, 2025  
**Status:** Structure corrected after Architect error  
**Location:** `reference/todo-july21/CsharP/`

## ðŸ“Š **CORRECTED STRUCTURE (5 AGENTS MAX)**

### **Agent Distribution:**
- **A1:** Core Foundation (g1, g2, g3, g4) - 12+ goals total
- **A2:** Communication & Messaging (g5, g6, g7, g8) - 12+ goals total  
- **A3:** Cloud & Infrastructure (g9, g10, g11, g12) - 12+ goals total
- **A4:** Security & Enterprise (g13, g14, g15, g16) - 12+ goals total
- **A5:** Testing & Validation (g17, g18, g19, g20) - 12+ goals total

### **G Folder Structure (Each Contains):**
- **prompt.txt** - Clear instructions with severe punishment warnings
- **goals.json** - 3+ specific goals with detailed requirements
- **ideas.json** - To be updated by agents during work
- **status.json** - Real-time progress tracking
- **summary.json** - Completion report

### **Sample G Folders Created:**
âœ… `a1/g1/` - Core Foundation (Cache, Query, Variable, Env)  
âœ… `a1/g2/` - Communication Core (gRPC, Webhook, AMQP)  
âœ… `a2/g5/` - Messaging Systems (Kafka, NATS, Neural)  
âœ… `a5/g17/` - Testing & Registry Validation  

## ðŸš¨ **KEY REQUIREMENTS ENFORCED:**
- **SEVERE PUNISHMENT** warnings in every prompt
- **NO PLACEHOLDERS** - production quality only
- **VELOCITY MODE** activated
- **90%+ test coverage** mandatory
- **Real service integration** required

## ðŸŽ¯ **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:**
1. All 28+ missing operators implemented
2. OperatorRegistry.cs synchronized with actual files
3. Comprehensive testing with 90%+ coverage
4. Performance exceeds PHP SDK by 50%
5. Complete documentation with XML comments
6. Real-time progress tracking via JSON files
