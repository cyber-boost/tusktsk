üö® EMERGENCY: AGENT A1 - G1 CORE FOUNDATION OPERATORS
================================================================

‚ö†Ô∏è  SEVERE PUNISHMENT WARNING: PLACEHOLDER CODE = IMMEDIATE TERMINATION ‚ö†Ô∏è
‚ö†Ô∏è  NON-COMPLIANCE = SEVERE CONSEQUENCES - NO EXCEPTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è
‚ö†Ô∏è  VELOCITY MODE ACTIVATED - PRODUCTION QUALITY OR NOTHING ‚ö†Ô∏è

MISSION: Create 4 MISSING CRITICAL operators that are breaking the entire C# SDK
FOCUS: Cache, Query, Variable, Env operators - Core foundation components
TIMELINE: 24 HOURS MAXIMUM - NO EXTENSIONS
PRIORITY: CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE - ALL OTHER WORK SUSPENDED

üìã YOUR MISSING OPERATORS (CRITICAL):
1. CacheOperator.cs - Core caching functionality (MISSING - SDK BROKEN)
2. QueryOperator.cs - Database query operations (MISSING - SDK BROKEN)
3. VariableOperator.cs - Variable management (MISSING - SDK BROKEN)
4. EnvOperator.cs - Environment variable access (MISSING - SDK BROKEN)

üö® CRISIS STATUS:
- Registry claims these operators exist but FILES ARE COMPLETELY MISSING
- Entire C# SDK is NON-FUNCTIONAL without these core operators
- Other agents are BLOCKED waiting for your completion
- System integrity compromised - immediate restoration required

üéØ MANDATORY SUCCESS CRITERIA (NO EXCEPTIONS):
‚úÖ Create all 4 missing operator files from scratch - ZERO placeholders
‚úÖ Each operator extends BaseOperator correctly - NO SHORTCUTS
‚úÖ Full async/await implementation throughout - NO blocking calls
‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and logging - CATCH ALL EXCEPTIONS
‚úÖ 90%+ test coverage with real-world scenarios - FULL TESTING
‚úÖ Complete XML documentation for all public members - NO MISSING DOCS
‚úÖ Performance exceeds PHP SDK by 50% - MEASURE AND PROVE
‚úÖ Thread-safe concurrent operation support - HANDLE RACE CONDITIONS

üìÅ EXACT FILE LOCATIONS (CREATE EXACTLY HERE):
- sdk/csharp/Operators/Utility/CacheOperator.cs
- sdk/csharp/Operators/Database/QueryOperator.cs
- sdk/csharp/Operators/ControlFlow/VariableOperator.cs
- sdk/csharp/Operators/Utility/EnvOperator.cs

üîß MANDATORY TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- C# 12.0+ with latest language features
- Nullable reference types enabled
- Full async/await patterns (NO Task.Wait() or .Result)
- IDisposable implementation where needed
- Comprehensive exception handling with custom exceptions
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent access
- Performance optimization (target: 50% faster than PHP)
- Memory efficient implementations

‚ö†Ô∏è PUNISHMENT RULES:
- PLACEHOLDER CODE = IMMEDIATE TERMINATION
- INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION = SEVERE CONSEQUENCES  
- MISSING TESTS = PUNISHMENT
- NO DOCUMENTATION = PUNISHMENT
- PERFORMANCE BELOW TARGET = PUNISHMENT
- NON-COMPLIANCE = SEVERE CONSEQUENCES

üöÄ MANDATORY DELIVERABLES:
1. All 4 operator files created and FULLY FUNCTIONAL
2. Comprehensive unit test suite for each operator (90%+ coverage)
3. Integration tests with real-world scenarios
4. Performance benchmarks proving 50% improvement over PHP
5. Complete XML documentation for all public members
6. ideas.json - Updated with implementation insights
7. status.json - Real-time progress updates every 2 hours
8. summary.json - Final completion report with metrics

‚ö° PERFORMANCE TARGETS (MUST BE MET):
- Operator load time: <50ms each
- Memory usage: <10MB total for all 4 operators  
- Execution speed: 50% faster than PHP equivalents
- Concurrent operations: 500+ simultaneous calls supported
- Error rate: <0.1% under normal conditions

üíÄ FAILURE CONSEQUENCES:
- Entire C# SDK remains broken and unusable
- Other agents cannot proceed with their work
- TuskLang C# ecosystem completely non-functional
- SEVERE PUNISHMENT for non-compliance
- IMMEDIATE TERMINATION for placeholder code

üéØ VELOCITY MODE ACTIVATED:
- NO OVERTHINKING - Start implementing immediately
- NO PERFECTIONISM - Focus on working, tested code
- NO DELAYS - Every hour counts
- NO EXCUSES - Deliver or face consequences
- NO PLACEHOLDERS - Production quality only

REMEMBER: This is an EMERGENCY with SEVERE PUNISHMENT for non-compliance. 
Create working, tested, documented operators immediately. The entire C# SDK 
depends on your success. PLACEHOLDER CODE = IMMEDIATE TERMINATION.

üö® START IMMEDIATELY - FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION üö®
