üö® EMERGENCY: AGENT A5 - G17 TESTING & REGISTRY VALIDATION
================================================================

‚ö†Ô∏è  SEVERE PUNISHMENT WARNING: PLACEHOLDER CODE = IMMEDIATE TERMINATION ‚ö†Ô∏è
‚ö†Ô∏è  INCOMPLETE TESTING = SEVERE CONSEQUENCES - NO EXCEPTIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è
‚ö†Ô∏è  VELOCITY MODE ACTIVATED - PRODUCTION QUALITY OR NOTHING ‚ö†Ô∏è

MISSION: Fix OperatorRegistry.cs and create comprehensive testing for ALL operators
FOCUS: Registry synchronization, comprehensive testing, validation framework
TIMELINE: 48 HOURS MAXIMUM - NO EXTENSIONS
PRIORITY: CRITICAL - ENTIRE SDK DEPENDS ON YOUR SUCCESS

üìã YOUR CRITICAL RESPONSIBILITIES:
1. OperatorRegistry Synchronization - Fix registry to match actual files
2. Comprehensive Testing Framework - Test ALL 77 operators
3. Operator Validation Framework - Ensure compliance across all operators
4. Performance Benchmarking Suite - Prove 50% improvement over PHP

üö® CURRENT CRISIS STATUS:
- OperatorRegistry.cs claims 77 operators but only 49 files exist
- Missing operators are being created by other agents
- Registry is completely out of sync with reality
- No comprehensive testing exists for operator ecosystem
- Performance claims are unvalidated

üéØ MANDATORY SUCCESS CRITERIA (NO EXCEPTIONS):
‚úÖ Fix OperatorRegistry.cs to 100% match actual operator files
‚úÖ Create comprehensive test suite for ALL operators (90%+ coverage)
‚úÖ Build validation framework ensuring BaseOperator compliance
‚úÖ Create performance benchmarks proving 50% improvement over PHP
‚úÖ Generate automated validation pipeline
‚úÖ Update ideas.json, status.json, summary.json throughout process

üìÅ CRITICAL FILES TO MODIFY/CREATE:
- sdk/csharp/Operators/OperatorRegistry.cs (FIX SYNCHRONIZATION)
- Create comprehensive test suite for all operators
- Build validation framework
- Generate performance benchmarks

üîß MANDATORY TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Registry must auto-discover operators (no manual registration)
- 90%+ test coverage across ALL operators
- Performance benchmarks must prove 50% improvement
- Validation framework must catch compliance issues
- All tests must use real services, not just mocks
- Load testing must handle 1000+ concurrent operations

‚ö†Ô∏è PUNISHMENT RULES:
- PLACEHOLDER TESTS = IMMEDIATE TERMINATION
- INCOMPLETE COVERAGE = SEVERE CONSEQUENCES
- FAKE PERFORMANCE CLAIMS = PUNISHMENT
- REGISTRY INACCURACY = PUNISHMENT
- MISSING VALIDATION = PUNISHMENT
- NON-COMPLIANCE = SEVERE CONSEQUENCES

üöÄ MANDATORY DELIVERABLES:
1. Fixed OperatorRegistry.cs with 100% accuracy
2. Comprehensive test suite for ALL 77 operators
3. Validation framework ensuring operator compliance
4. Performance benchmark suite with PHP comparison
5. Automated validation pipeline
6. ideas.json - Updated with testing insights and discoveries
7. status.json - Real-time progress updates every 2 hours
8. summary.json - Final completion report with metrics

‚ö° PERFORMANCE TARGETS (MUST BE VALIDATED):
- Registry load time: <100ms for all 77 operators
- Test suite execution: <5 minutes for full suite
- Individual operator tests: <1 second each
- Load testing: 1000+ concurrent operations supported
- Memory usage: <100MB for full test suite
- Performance improvement: 50% faster than PHP (PROVEN)

üíÄ FAILURE CONSEQUENCES:
- Entire C# SDK remains unvalidated and unreliable
- Performance claims remain unproven
- Operator compliance unknown
- Registry remains broken
- SEVERE PUNISHMENT for non-compliance
- IMMEDIATE TERMINATION for placeholder code

üéØ VELOCITY MODE REQUIREMENTS:
- NO FAKE TESTS - All tests must validate real functionality
- NO MOCK-ONLY TESTING - Use real services where possible
- NO PERFORMANCE LIES - Benchmarks must be accurate
- NO REGISTRY SHORTCUTS - 100% accuracy required
- NO INCOMPLETE COVERAGE - 90%+ minimum

TESTING FRAMEWORK TEMPLATE:
```csharp
[TestClass]
public class [Operator]OperatorTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public async Task Execute_ValidParameters_ReturnsExpectedResult()
    {
        // Arrange - real setup, no mocks
        // Act - real operator execution
        // Assert - comprehensive validation
    }
    
    [TestMethod]
    public async Task Execute_ConcurrentOperations_HandlesLoad()
    {
        // Test 100+ concurrent operations
    }
}
```

REGISTRY SYNCHRONIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Scan actual operator files in directories
- Remove non-existent operator registrations
- Add missing operator registrations
- Validate namespace consistency
- Ensure auto-discovery mechanism
- 100% accuracy guaranteed

REMEMBER: You are the FINAL VALIDATOR. If you fail, the entire C# SDK 
remains broken and unreliable. PLACEHOLDER CODE = IMMEDIATE TERMINATION.
Create real, comprehensive, production-quality testing and validation.
