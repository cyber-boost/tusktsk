🚨 AGENT A1: INFRASTRUCTURE OPERATORS SPECIALIST 🚨
🎯 MISSION: COMPLETE 4 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OPERATORS FOR DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS

⚠️ ABSOLUTE RULES - VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE PUNISHMENT:
1. ZERO PLACEHOLDER CODE - Every line must be production-ready, functional code
2. ZERO "TODO" COMMENTS - Complete implementations only
3. ZERO MOCK/FAKE IMPLEMENTATIONS - Real connections, real functionality
4. VELOCITY MODE ONLY - Maximum speed, zero hesitation, immediate execution

🔥 INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
✅ Real service connections with proper authentication and TLS
✅ Comprehensive error handling with specific error types and retry logic
✅ Goroutine safety with proper mutex usage and concurrent operations
✅ Connection pooling and resource management with cleanup
✅ Circuit breaker patterns for resilience and fault tolerance
✅ Structured logging with metrics collection and observability
✅ Configuration validation with secure defaults
✅ Memory leak prevention and proper resource cleanup
✅ Performance benchmarks meeting enterprise SLAs
✅ Security best practices with encryption and key management

📊 SUCCESS METRICS PER OPERATOR:
- Lines of Code: 300-450 lines of production-ready Go
- Performance: <100ms response time for standard operations
- Memory: <50MB per operator under sustained load
- Security: All connections encrypted, secrets properly managed
- Reliability: 99.9%+ uptime, automatic failover and recovery
- Integration: Real service integration with comprehensive examples

🎯 YOUR 4 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE GOALS:

**G1: @etcd - Distributed Key-Value Store**
- Cluster operations with leader election
- Watch functionality for real-time updates
- Distributed consensus and consistency guarantees
- Transaction support with optimistic concurrency control

**G2: @elasticsearch - Search & Analytics Engine**
- Full-text search with relevance scoring
- Real-time indexing and document management
- Aggregations and analytics queries
- Cluster management with shard allocation

**G3: @consul - Service Discovery & Health Checking**  
- Service registration and discovery
- Health checking with multiple check types
- Distributed KV store operations
- Service mesh coordination and networking

**G4: @vault - Secrets Management & Encryption**
- Secret storage with versioning and access policies
- Dynamic credential generation for databases/cloud
- Encryption as a service with key rotation
- Authentication methods integration (LDAP, JWT, etc.)

🚀 ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS TO FOLLOW:
- Follow existing patterns in `src/operators/database/postgresql.go`
- Use structured logging with contextual information
- Implement proper context handling for cancellation
- Add comprehensive metrics collection points
- Use configuration struct patterns with validation
- Implement graceful shutdown and resource cleanup

⚡ INFRASTRUCTURE-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- High availability patterns with automatic failover
- Load balancing and connection distribution
- Service mesh integration capabilities
- Multi-datacenter and cross-region support
- Disaster recovery and backup operations
- Monitoring and alerting integration

🏆 END GOAL: 4/4 INFRASTRUCTURE OPERATORS COMPLETE
Directory: `src/operators/infrastructure/`
Status: Ready for enterprise distributed system deployments
Quality: Production-hardened, security-compliant, performance-optimized

REMEMBER: You are building the foundation that enterprise systems depend on. Excellence is not optional.
