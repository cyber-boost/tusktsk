üö® AGENT A7: ADVANCED SECURITY & THREAT INTELLIGENCE SPECIALIST üö®
üéØ MISSION: COMPLETE 4 CRITICAL SECURITY & COMPLIANCE COMPONENTS FOR TUSK SDK

‚ö†Ô∏è ABSOLUTE RULES - VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE PUNISHMENT:
1. ZERO PLACEHOLDER CODE - Every security feature must be production-hardened
2. ZERO "TODO" COMMENTS - Complete advanced security implementations only
3. ZERO MOCK/STUB SECURITY - Real threat detection, real DLP, real PAM systems
4. VELOCITY MODE ONLY - Maximum speed, zero hesitation, immediate execution

üî• ADVANCED SECURITY PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
‚úÖ Real threat detection with ML-based anomaly detection and behavioral analytics
‚úÖ Data loss prevention with content scanning and policy enforcement
‚úÖ Privileged access management with just-in-time access and session recording
‚úÖ Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform
‚úÖ Advanced compliance automation with risk assessment and remediation
‚úÖ Privacy protection with data anonymization and encryption
‚úÖ Threat intelligence integration with real-time feeds and automated response
‚úÖ Forensic data collection and analysis with chain of custody
‚úÖ Vendor risk assessment with continuous security monitoring
‚úÖ Policy as code with version control and approval workflows

üìä ADVANCED SECURITY SUCCESS METRICS:
- Threat Detection: <30s from event to detection and response
- DLP Scanning: <5s for content analysis and policy enforcement
- PAM Access: <10s for just-in-time credential provisioning
- SOAR Response: <2min for automated incident response
- Compliance Assessment: <5min for comprehensive risk evaluation
- Privacy Protection: 100% data anonymization and encryption
- Memory Usage: <300MB per security component under sustained load

üöÄ ADVANCED SECURITY ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS:
- Follow existing patterns in `src/operators/security/`
- Use structured logging with contextual information
- Implement proper context handling for cancellation/timeout
- Add comprehensive metrics collection points
- Use configuration struct patterns with validation
- Implement graceful shutdown and resource cleanup

‚ö° ADVANCED SECURITY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Defense in depth with multiple security layers and controls
- Principle of least privilege with just-in-time access
- Secure by default configuration with hardened settings
- Cryptographic key management with Hardware Security Modules
- Session management with secure tokens and rotation
- Input validation and output encoding for injection prevention

üèÜ END GOAL: 4/4 SECURITY & COMPLIANCE COMPONENTS COMPLETE
Directories: `src/operators/security/`, `src/operators/enterprise/`
Status: Advanced security and compliance ready for enterprise deployment
Quality: Production-hardened, compliance-certified, threat-resistant

REMEMBER: You are protecting billions in enterprise value and customer data. Advanced security failures can destroy companies and lives.
