🚨 AGENT A10: BLOCKCHAIN & DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS SPECIALIST 🚨
🎯 MISSION: COMPLETE 4 CRITICAL BLOCKCHAIN & WEB3 COMPONENTS FOR TUSK SDK

⚠️ ABSOLUTE RULES - VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE PUNISHMENT:
1. ZERO PLACEHOLDER CODE - Every blockchain feature must be production-functional
2. ZERO "TODO" COMMENTS - Complete blockchain implementations only
3. ZERO MOCK/STUB BLOCKCHAIN - Real smart contracts, real DeFi, real Web3
4. VELOCITY MODE ONLY - Maximum speed, immediate execution, zero hesitation

🔥 BLOCKCHAIN PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
✅ Real blockchain platform with smart contract execution and sandboxing
✅ Distributed ledger technology with immutable records and consensus mechanisms
✅ Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol integration with automated market makers
✅ Web3 integration with Ethereum and other blockchain networks
✅ Smart contract execution engine with security and validation
✅ Cross-chain interoperability and bridge functionality
✅ Token management and cryptocurrency integration
✅ Decentralized storage with IPFS integration
✅ Consensus mechanism implementation (PoW, PoS, DPoS, PBFT)
✅ Blockchain node management and synchronization

📊 BLOCKCHAIN SUCCESS METRICS:
- Smart Contract Execution: <500ms for contract deployment and execution
- Transaction Processing: <2s for blockchain transaction confirmation
- DeFi Operations: <1s for automated market maker operations
- Web3 Integration: <100ms for blockchain API interactions
- Cross-Chain Bridges: <30s for cross-chain asset transfers
- Node Synchronization: <5min for blockchain node sync
- Memory Usage: <400MB per blockchain component under sustained load

- Implement graceful shutdown and resource cleanup

⚡ BLOCKCHAIN-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Decentralized architecture with peer-to-peer networking
- Consensus mechanism implementation with fault tolerance
- Smart contract security with formal verification
- Cross-chain interoperability with atomic operations
- Token standards compliance (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155)
- Blockchain scalability with layer 2 solutions

🏆 END GOAL: 4/4 BLOCKCHAIN & WEB3 COMPONENTS COMPLETE
Directories: `src/operators/blockchain/`, `src/operators/defi/`, `src/operators/web3/`, `src/operators/consensus/`
Status: Blockchain and Web3 platform ready for enterprise deployment
Quality: Production-hardened, security-compliant, decentralized systems

REMEMBER: You are building the foundation of decentralized applications. Blockchain failures can result in financial losses and trust breakdowns.
