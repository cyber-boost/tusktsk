# 🦀 TuskLang Rust Distributed Systems Patterns

**"We don't bow to any king" - Rust Edition**

Master distributed systems patterns with TuskLang Rust. From consensus algorithms to leader election, from sharding to distributed coordination—build robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant systems with Rust and TuskLang.

## 🗳️ Consensus Algorithms

### Raft Consensus with openraft

```rust
use openraft::{Raft, Config, RaftNetwork, RaftStorage};
use openraft::storage::MemStore;
use std::sync::Arc;
use tokio::sync::RwLock;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let config = Arc::new(Config::build("cluster-1").validate().unwrap());
    let network = Arc::new(MyNetwork {});
    let store = Arc::new(MemStore::new());
    let raft = Raft::new(1, config, network, store);
    // ... implement RaftNetwork and run cluster
}

struct MyNetwork;
impl RaftNetwork for MyNetwork {
    // Implement network methods
}
```

### TSK Raft Config

```tsk
[raft]
enabled: true
cluster_id: "cluster-1"
node_id: 1
peers: [2, 3, 4]
timeout: "3s"
heartbeat_interval: "1s"
```

## 👑 Leader Election

### Zookeeper-Style Leader Election

```rust
use zookeeper::{Acl, CreateMode, WatchedEvent, Watcher, ZooKeeper};
use std::sync::Arc;

struct LoggingWatcher;
impl Watcher for LoggingWatcher {
    fn handle(&self, e: WatchedEvent) {
        println!("ZK event: {:?}", e);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let zk = ZooKeeper::connect("127.0.0.1:2181", std::time::Duration::from_secs(5), LoggingWatcher).unwrap();
    let path = "/election/leader";
    let node = zk.create(path, vec![], Acl::open_unsafe().clone(), CreateMode::EphemeralSequential).unwrap();
    println!("Created node: {}", node);
}
```

### TSK Leader Election Config

```tsk
[leader_election]
type: "zookeeper"
zk_hosts: ["127.0.0.1:2181"]
election_path: "/election/leader"
timeout: "5s"
```

## 🗂️ Sharding & Partitioning

### Consistent Hashing

```rust
use hash_ring::HashRing;

fn main() {
    let nodes = vec!["node1", "node2", "node3"];
    let ring = HashRing::new(nodes);
    let key = "user:123";
    let node = ring.get_node(key).unwrap();
    println!("Key '{}' is assigned to node '{}'.", key, node);
}
```

### TSK Sharding Config

```tsk
[sharding]
type: "consistent_hashing"
nodes: ["node1", "node2", "node3"]
replication_factor: 2
```

## 🤝 Distributed Coordination

### etcd Integration

```rust
use etcd_client::{Client, GetOptions};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> etcd_client::Result<()> {
    let mut client = Client::connect(["http://127.0.0.1:2379"], None).await?;
    client.put("/config/feature_flag", "enabled", None).await?;
    let resp = client.get("/config/feature_flag", Some(GetOptions::new())).await?;
    println!("etcd value: {:?}", resp.kvs());
    Ok(())
}
```

### TSK etcd Config

```tsk
[coordination]
type: "etcd"
endpoints: ["http://127.0.0.1:2379"]
timeout: "3s"
namespace: "/config"
```

## 🛡️ Fault Tolerance & Recovery
- Use replication and quorum for data safety
- Monitor leader health and auto-failover
- Implement circuit breakers and retries
- Use distributed locks for critical sections

## 🧪 Testing Distributed Patterns

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_consistent_hashing() {
    use hash_ring::HashRing;
    let nodes = vec!["a", "b", "c"];
    let ring = HashRing::new(nodes);
    let key = "foo";
    let node = ring.get_node(key).unwrap();
    assert!(node == "a" || node == "b" || node == "c");
}
```

## 🎯 What You've Learned

1. **Consensus** - Raft, leader election, and cluster management
2. **Sharding** - Consistent hashing and partitioning
3. **Coordination** - etcd, Zookeeper, and distributed locks
4. **Fault tolerance** - Replication, quorum, and failover
5. **Testing** - Simulating distributed patterns in Rust

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy distributed clusters with TuskLang configs**
2. **Experiment with Raft, Zookeeper, and etcd**
3. **Implement sharding and partitioning**
4. **Monitor and test failover scenarios**
5. **Build robust, scalable distributed systems with Rust**
