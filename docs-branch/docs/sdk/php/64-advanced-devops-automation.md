## CI/CD Pipelines

```php
// config/cicd.tsk
cicd = {
    provider = "github_actions"
    stages = ["build", "test", "deploy"]
    notifications = {
        slack = true
        email = true
    }
    environment = {
        APP_ENV = "staging"
        DB_HOST = "@env('DB_HOST')"
    }
}
```

## Infrastructure as Code

- Use Terraform, Pulumi, or CloudFormation
- Manage infrastructure state with TuskLang
- Use @ operators for dynamic provisioning

## Automated Testing

- Integrate PHPUnit, Pest, or Codeception
- Use TuskLang for test environment config
- Automate test data setup and teardown

## Deployment Strategies

- Blue/Green deployments
- Canary releases
- Feature flags and progressive delivery
- Zero-downtime migrations

## Monitoring and Rollback

- Integrate with Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry
- Use TuskLang for alerting and rollback triggers

## Security Automation

- Automate vulnerability scanning
- Enforce secrets management
- Use TuskLang for policy as code

## Best Practices

- Automate everything
- Use version control for all config
- Monitor, alert, and rollback on failure
- Secure the pipeline and infrastructure
