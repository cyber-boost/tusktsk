# Advanced Serverless Patterns

TuskLang enables PHP developers to build, deploy, and scale serverless applications with ease. This guide covers advanced serverless patterns, event-driven architectures, and deployment strategies.

## Serverless Functions

```php
// config/serverless.tsk
serverless = {
    provider = "aws_lambda"
    runtime = "php-8.2"
    memory = 512
    timeout = 30
    environment = {
        APP_ENV = "production"
        DB_HOST = "@env('DB_HOST')"
    }
    layers = ["arn:aws:lambda:layer:php-extensions"]
}
```

## Event Sources

```php
// config/events.tsk
event_sources = {
    http = {
        path = "/webhook"
        method = "POST"
    }
    s3 = {
        bucket = "my-bucket"
        event = "s3:ObjectCreated:*"
    }
    sqs = {
        queue = "my-queue"
    }
}
```

## Cold Start Optimization

- Use provisioned concurrency
- Minimize package size
- Warm up functions with scheduled events
- Use lightweight PHP frameworks

## Stateful Serverless

- Use external state stores (Redis, DynamoDB, RDS)
- Store session data in encrypted cookies or external cache
- Leverage TuskLang config for dynamic state

## Serverless API Gateways

```php
// config/api-gateway.tsk
api_gateway = {
    provider = "aws_api_gateway"
    endpoints = ["/api/*"]
    authentication = "jwt"
    cors = {
        allow_origins = ["*"]
        allow_methods = ["GET", "POST"]
    }
}
```

## Observability and Monitoring

```php
// config/observability.tsk
observability = {
    tracing = true
    provider = "x-ray"
    metrics = true
    logs = true
}
```

## Security

- Use least privilege IAM roles
- Encrypt environment variables
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## Best Practices

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Monitor cold starts and optimize
- Secure all endpoints and data
- Automate deployments with CI/CD
