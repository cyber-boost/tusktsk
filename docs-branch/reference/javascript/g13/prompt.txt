TASK: Execute goals for JavaScript agent a3 goal 13
LANGUAGE: JavaScript
WORKING DIRECTORY: g13

CONTEXT: You are working on the TuskLang JavaScript SDK (a3 agent). Complete the specified goals efficiently and update the tracking files.

EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Complete the following goals (see goals.json for details):
   - g13.1: Goal 1 implementation
   - g13.2: Goal 2 implementation  
   - g13.3: Goal 3 implementation

2. TIME LIMIT: Complete all tasks within 15 minutes maximum

3. Upon completion, update these files:
   - ../status.json: Set "g13": true and increment completed_goals
   - ../summary.json: Add entry with timestamp, tasks completed, methods used
   - ../ideas.json: Add at least one innovative approach discovered or feature that should be built or problem to be addressed ! important, !! very important, !!! absolutely urgent life or death

4. Use minimal testing - basic functionality verification only

5. Before writing any file, check for locks using file locking mechanism:
   - Check if ../status.json has "file_locks" entry for current operation
   - Use timestamp-based locking: create lock with current timestamp
   - Release lock after operation completes

6. All file paths must be relative to current directory

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
- Focus on JavaScript-specific best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Use appropriate testing frameworks
- Optimize for performance where applicable
- Follow language conventions and patterns

REFERENCES:
- Parent directory files: ../status.json, ../summary.json, ../ideas.json
- Current goals: ./goals.json
- JavaScript SDK location: ../../sdk/javascript/

BEGIN IMMEDIATELY. Time is critical.
