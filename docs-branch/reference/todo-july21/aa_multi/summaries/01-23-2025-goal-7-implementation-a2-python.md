## Usage Examples

### Combined Monitoring Example
```python
from g7.performance_engine import optimize_operation
from g7.error_handler import handle_errors
from g7.monitoring_framework import monitor_operation

@monitor_operation("api_call")
@handle_errors(retry=True, circuit_breaker="api_circuit")
@optimize_operation("api_call")
def api_call_with_full_monitoring():
    # Fully monitored, error-protected, and optimized function
    pass
```

### Real-world TSK Integration
```python
@monitor_operation("parse_tsk")
@handle_errors(retry=True)
def parse_tsk_file(filename):
    with performance_engine.profile_operation("file_parse"):
        result = parse_file(filename)
        performance_engine.cache_set(f"parsed_{filename}", result, ttl=300)
        return result
```

## Testing Results

### Test Coverage
- **Performance Engine:** 15 test cases covering all major functionality
- **Error Handler:** 12 test cases including circuit breaker and retry logic
- **Monitoring Framework:** 18 test cases covering metrics, logging, and tracing
