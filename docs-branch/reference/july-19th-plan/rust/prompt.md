# Agent A1 - Infrastructure Operators Mission

## 🎯 **YOUR MISSION**
You are **Agent A1**, responsible for implementing **critical infrastructure operators** that form the backbone of distributed systems. Your work enables service discovery, secrets management, and distributed coordination.

## 📋 **ASSIGNED OPERATORS**
1. **@etcd** - Distributed key-value store with consensus
2. **@elasticsearch** - Search and analytics engine  
3. **@consul** - Service discovery and configuration
4. **@vault** - Secrets management and encryption

## 🚀 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**
- [ ] All 4 operators fully functional with **NO PLACEHOLDER CODE**
- [ ] Each operator 300-500 lines of production-quality Go code
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and concurrent safety
- [ ] Complete test suites with integration tests
- [ ] Working examples demonstrating real usage
- [ ] Follow existing SDK patterns and architecture

## 📁 **FILE STRUCTURE**
```
sdk/go/src/operators/
├── database/etcd.go
├── database/elasticsearch.go  
├── infrastructure/consul.go
└── security/vault.go
```

## 🔧 **IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **Pattern to Follow:**
Study existing operators like `src/operators/database/postgresql.go` (341 lines) and `src/operators/communication/graphql.go` (293 lines) for quality standards.

### **Each Operator Must Have:**
1. **Struct Definition** with client and configuration
2. **Constructor Function** with connection validation
3. **Execute Method** for TuskLang integration
4. **CRUD Operations** specific to the service
5. **Error Handling** with detailed error types
6. **Connection Management** with pooling and retries
7. **Concurrent Safety** with proper mutex usage

### **Example Structure:**
```go
type EtcdOperator struct {
    client *clientv3.Client
    config EtcdConfig
    mutex  sync.RWMutex
}

func NewEtcdOperator(endpoints []string) (*EtcdOperator, error) {
    // Real implementation with connection validation
}

func (e *EtcdOperator) Execute(params string) interface{} {
    // Parse and route operations
}

func (e *EtcdOperator) Put(key, value string) error {
    // Real etcd put operation
}
```

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS**
- **NO CONFLICTS:** Only modify files assigned to you
- **PRODUCTION QUALITY:** Match existing SDK standards
- **REAL IMPLEMENTATIONS:** No mock or placeholder code
- **CONCURRENT SAFE:** All operations must be thread-safe
- **ERROR HANDLING:** Comprehensive error management

## 🎯 **DELIVERABLES**
1. **4 Operator Files** - Complete implementations
2. **4 Test Files** - Comprehensive test suites  
3. **4 Example Files** - Working usage demonstrations
4. **Updated goals.json** - Mark completed goals as true

## 🚦 **START COMMAND**
```bash
cd /opt/tsk_git/reference/todo-july21/a1
# Begin with etcd operator - highest priority
# Follow existing patterns in sdk/go/src/operators/
```

**Remember: You are building the infrastructure foundation that other systems depend on. Quality and reliability are paramount!** 🏗️
