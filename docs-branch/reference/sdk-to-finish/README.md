## Notes

- All SDKs have a solid foundation with complete core functionality
- The main gap is in advanced operators and enterprise features
- JavaScript SDK leads in overall completeness
- Bash SDK needs the most work but serves a different use case
- Enterprise features are completely missing across all SDKs
